# Fun.DevTools

I created this to use dotnet core WASM to run some helper functions on the browser to help me complish some tasks.

Currently it contains:

- Convert from html string to Fun.Blazor CE
- Flat multiple JSON files to compare. Which can be used to edit i18n json files.
- Convert between base64 encoded and decoded string
